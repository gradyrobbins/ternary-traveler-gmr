# Ternary Traveler

The Ternary Traveler
You've been asked to put together a simple application for your client, Mira. Mira is a travel blogger who creates both videos and writes blog posts for her website. She tries to travel to three destinations per month, spending a week in each place. Then she takes a week off before starting the whole cycle again. She has requested a Browserify application using JSON-Server, where she can add points of interests for the next set of three places she will be visiting. She would like to be able to add a new point of interest in one of her destinations so she can have a list of places she needs to visit when she travels. As she visits each point of interest, she would like to be able to edit the point of interest by adjusting the cost and adding a review. She has also asked to be able to delete points of interest from her list. But to ensure she does not accidentally delete anything, she would like an alert to to confirm the delete action.
